My first program
* Describe your coding process
    * In the beginning was it difficult to learn how to program. 
    It was a whole new language and a very difficult one at first. 
    We learned the basics and how to start the code, with writing createCanvas, to create that window, 
    and the size of that, our program should be shown. So far so good. Next we had to do function draw. 
    Here do we write the codes to which figures, colors, lines and so on, that is going to be shown in the program. 
    In the beginning I was very confused, and I was thinking that I’m never gonna learn this. 
    But suddenly it all came into place, and i startet creating something - now its beginning to be fun. 
    First its just a cirkel, but then you start putting different figures in, and you make something. 
    And that is a big win for one who never thought that I was going to learn this. 
    It makes you wanna do more and learn more, by doing. 
    
    * What constitutes a program?
    * A program it a set of codes which forms a program as a final result. At first you have to insert the basics codes to
    even start making different figures and colors. 

* Reflect on the notion of error (what is error to you?)
    * An error kan variate in different kinds of state. You can run into big and small errors. 
    Big errors will often ruin the result of the programming, and even be that big, that the program can’t run. 
    An error isn’t necessarily something that makes your program crash. A small error can also be a big deal in programming. 
    The small error is shown in the final result and therefore disturb the eye. It can be a line or an figure
    that is placed wrong, like shown in my program.
